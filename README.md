# machine-learning-kmeans-
I implemented the kmeans algorithm on three different data sets.

The datasets took in data from  the birthrate and life expectancy
from countries recorded in 1953 and again in 2008, the third data
set combines the previous two. It gives the user the choice of
which data sets to use and the amount of iterations to be done by
the program as well as the amount of clusters to be used

The centroids of the clusters are determined using the Euclidean distance

It then uses the Python library Matplotlib to visually represent
the datapoints and centroids of the clusters they belong to.
